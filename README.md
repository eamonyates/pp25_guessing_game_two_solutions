Python Practice 25 - Guessing Game Two Solutions

In a previous exercise, we’ve written a program that “knows” a number and asks a user to guess it.

This time, we’re going to do exactly the opposite. You, the user, will have in your head a number between 0 and 100. The program will guess a number, and you, the user, will say whether it is too high, too low, or your number.

At the end of this exchange, your program should print out how many guesses it took to get your number.
